Research on Landsat articles through Purdue libraries


This repository contains files regarding the retrieval and analysis of SCOPUS articles regarding the Landsat program from 2022-1975. 

The Retrieval folder contains files used to retrieve data from SCOPUS.

The old analysis folder contains some term overlap networks and connection spreadsheets based on the SCOPUS articles, but is not the current analysis.

The Connection Spreadsheets folder contains spreadsheets logging the number of times keywords in articles overlap, separated by year group.

The Connection Networks folder contains html pages which are networks displaying the information from the connection spreadsheets.

The Landsat_abstracts_with_keywords_count spreadsheet contains the cleaned data from all Landsat articles. The Connection Finding file is used to turn this information into a connection spreadsheet, which the Lansat Network file turns into an html network.
